  <div class="transparcy">
    <h3 class="transhead">transparcy</h3>
    <p class="transpara">Fragrance is a common term used in the cosmetics industry to describe a mixture of chemicals that create a certain scent in a product. "Fragrance" can also be used as a catch-all for a wide range of potentially harmful ingredients, including allergens, hormone and endocrine disruptors and other potential long term health concerns.</p>

  <div class="craftsmanship">
    <h3 class="crafthead">craftsmanship</h3>
    <p class="craftpara">The secret of our success undoubtedly lies in the pride of place accorded to craftsmanship and traditional skills. Our perfumes are entirely handmade, from the perfume itself, all the way to the packaging. After 6 weeks of maceration the resulting liquid is filtered and cooled prior to bottling. This process allows the perfume to reveal its full character and refinement. Each bottle is produced by glass blowing, according to the traditional method. Once the bottles are filled, they are closed individually by hand.</p>
